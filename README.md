## PROJECT FINISHED

### Custom features added
Here are a few features that were not included in the original Boss Level Challenge guidelines. However, I considered it right to add them both for the extra challenge and to improve the experience.
- Added certain guardrails to prevent things like the player interacting with the buttons before the sequence is even over.
- Added a number of attempts before the game is over. This way, failing a level doesn't automatically take you to the first one.
- Now you can actually win the game. 5 levels and you win the game + a little victory animation.
